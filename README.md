Repository about me.

My name is Lindsey Mahler and I am a Senior SMAD major at James Madison University. With a concentration in Interactive Design and Minor in Human Resource Development. I enjoy watching sports and hanging out with my friends over the weekends. Last year, I worked as a waitress while also doing freelance work related to my major; managing a small business social media account, creating a promo video for Phi Sigma Sigma at JMU, and creating logos for family businesses.
